### 2. Contents of the Appendix

## [Appendix (9 IEEE double-column pages in total, please remember to click "More Pages" button in the Github PDF Viewer and see theorem validation results)](https://github.com/Canhui/AppendixBTC/blob/main/Appendix.pdf)
"Appendix.pdf" is the appendix, including appendix A (i.e., description of the mining strategy), appendix B (i.e., estimate daily computing power), appendix C (i.e., proofs), appendix D (i.e., case study), appendix E (i.e., transaction size after versus before SegWit), appendix F (i.e., measuring dynamic of daily BTC price), and appendix G (i.e., the low-profitable ratio of daily mining revenue to daily computing power). 

## [Sample Code](https://github.com/Canhui/AppendixBTC/blob/main/codeTB1.m)
"codeTB1.m" is the Matlab implementation for a sample at Table III in the appendix.

## [Example One](https://github.com/Canhui/AppendixBTC/blob/main/eg1_1.m)
"eg1_1.m" is the Matlab source code about optimal pure strategies for Table VI in the main manuscript.

## [Example Two](https://github.com/Canhui/AppendixBTC/blob/main/eg1_2.m)
"eg1_2.m" is the Matlab source code about optimal pure strategies for Table VII in the main manuscript.

## [Example Three](https://github.com/Canhui/AppendixBTC/blob/main/eg2_1.m)
"eg2_1.m" is the Matlab source code about optimal pure strategies for Table VIII in the main manuscript.

## [Example Four](https://github.com/Canhui/AppendixBTC/blob/main/eg2_2.m)
"eg2_2.m" is the Matlab source code about optimal pure strategies for Table IX in the main manuscript.
